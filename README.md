# Terraform Azure Project: My Learning Log

This repository is my space to document a slow, intentional journey into Azure Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

## Why I’m Doing This
In the past, I worked with Terraform under heavy deadlines. I once spent a frantic 24 hours straight adapting a vendor-provided template just to get a hybrid hub-and-spoke production environment running in Azure. It worked—but the process was chaotic, and I didn’t have time to truly understand what was happening.  

This time, I’m approaching Terraform differently: slowing down, digging into each step, and writing down what I learn along the way.
