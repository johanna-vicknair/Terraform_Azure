# Terraform Azure Project: My Learning Log

This repository is my space to document a slow, intentional journey into Azure Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

## Why I’m Doing This

In the past, I worked with Terraform under heavy deadlines. I once spent a frantic 24 hours straight adapting a vendor-provided template just to get a hybrid hub-and-spoke production environment running in Azure. It worked but the process was chaotic, and I didn’t feel confident in my understanding..  

I’m approaching this project with patience; slowing down, exploring each step, and writing to strengthen my foundational understanding of Azure and Terraform.

## What I Hope to Accomplish

My goal is to strengthen my foundational skills by focusing on:

* Mastering Git commands and version control
* Using Visual Studio Code to manage repositories in GitHub
* Deploying Azure services with Terraform
* Improving the quality and structure of my Terraform code
* Establishing a CI/CD pipeline to enable automation  
* Keeping better personal documentation for learning and accountability
